# 02 Challenge for Advanced CSS

## Initial note to graders.

This is not a completed work by even to most generous of definitions. I have struggled with the CSS structure for hours with only frustrating, ineffectual results.  I am going to turn in "something" with the understanding that I will continue to edit and refine the portfolio as my competency grows.  

## Description

This challenge is to create a portfolio that showcases completed coding project that can be shown to others, especially potential employers. This portfolio will be presented as a functioning webpage using HTML and CSS languages which will allow anyone who looks to see a small about me paragraph, up to five completed application projects and ways to contact me. The page should be in a responsive design format.
